# Python-codes
A collection of my Python codes I have written to help automate my life/ job - or just for fun!

I used Chat-GPT to help me with these codes. I came up with the ideas for them each myself, and then wrote out a script for what I was intending using Jupyter Labs. Then when I experienced troubles I would talk through it with Chat-GPT. Each time I got assistance I would ask it to explain the difference between what I wrote and what it wrote, and the underlying concepts. 

As I write more scripts, I need less explainations! Or - I feel ready to dive into harder topics.

Want to download a .csv file for yourself? No problem. You can find it [Here](https://anniesanalytics.wixsite.com/annie-nelson/single-project). Just click on the Excel file icon!

You will also find some Chat-GPT assisted demo projects in here where I write out the dialogue between me and Chat-GPT. This is so beginners can see how approachable it is!
