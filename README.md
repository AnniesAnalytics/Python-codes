# Python-codes
A collection of my Python codes I have written to help automate my life/ job - or just for fun!

I used Chat-GPT to help me with these codes. I came up with the ideas for them each myself, and then wrote out a script for what I was intending using Jupyter Labs. Then when I experienced troubles I would talk through it with Chat-GPT. Each time I got assistance I would ask it to explain the difference between what I wrote and what it wrote, and the underlying concepts. 

As I write more scripts, I need less explainations! Or - I feel ready to dive into harder topics.

You will also find some Chat-GPT assisted demo projects in here where I write out the dialogue between me and Chat-GPT. This is so beginners can see how approachable it is!


# Scripts I actually used at my job

The ["Operations Dataset Generator"](https://github.com/AnniesAnalytics/Python-codes/blob/main/Operations%20Dataset%20Generator%20Script) script is one that took me a lot of time and thought to write. It creates a multi-table dataset about a store's operations department. This script has carefully been created to not just generate random data, but to generate meaningful data that you can analyze and pull trends out of. It is also adjustable, so you can choose to add dysfunction or a price increase into just one of the dataset.

The ["Cleaning Files"](https://github.com/AnniesAnalytics/Python-codes/blob/main/Cleaning%20Files) script is one I actually run intermittently with one of my customers who has to do a lot of manual data entry.


# Scripts for Making Dirty Data for my Book/ Portfolio
Want to see my conversation with Chat-GPT to make a Python script to dirty up data (that I had created, using ChatGPT and Python)? [Here](https://chat.openai.com/share/46a41a2d-99a0-4f61-8343-1b2a233817fc) is a link to the conversation. [Here](https://github.com/AnniesAnalytics/Python-codes/blob/main/Dirty%20Ops%20Data.ipynb) is the code it produced. And [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/103z4xAs9G7Z6CD7WhLKAjgUr3XoMPpnt?usp=sharing) is where you can download the data.

[This](https://github.com/AnniesAnalytics/Python-codes/blob/main/dirty%20pizza%20sales%20data.ipynb) is the script for taking [Maven Analytics' Pizza Data](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?dataStructure=2lXwWbWANQgI727tVx3DRC) and dirtying it up. You can find the dirty data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YeslHuqHf4-e75PnZJLXYGZXmRCZ_5uN?usp=sharing).
